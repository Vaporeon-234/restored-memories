# Restored Memories

Hello! This is going to be my new book, called restored memories. It is about how a normal student in her school remembers her journey in Year 1 and how she remembers all her friends and teachers again! Touching story (I hope) but yeah :) Hope you like it!

P.S. for those who know it's kinda a crossover between Candy JEM series and the Prince series by [Gempak starz](https://www.shop.gempakstarz.com/) so if you wanna collab you can see the [Candy JEM fandom](https://candymeow-series.fandom.com/wiki/Candy_Meow_Series_Wikia) and the [Prince series fandom](https://prince-series-gempak-starz.fandom.com/wiki/Charles) for background info!

P.P.S. I'm gonna put stuff like girl 1 and stuff or just a random emoji so if you wanna out your name there you can if you want
