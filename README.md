# Restored Memories

Hello! This is going to be my new book, called restored memories. It is about how a normal student in her school remembers her journey in Year 1 and how she remembers all her friends and teachers again! Touching story (I hope) but yeah :) Hope you like it!

P.S. for those who know it's kinda a crossover between Candy JEM series and the Prince series by Gempak starz so if you wanna collab you can see the Candy JEM fandom and the Prince series fandom for background info!
