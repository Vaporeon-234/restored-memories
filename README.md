# Restored Memories

Hello! This is going to be my new book, called restored memories. It is about how a normal student in her school remembers her journey in Year 1 and how she remembers all her friends and teachers again! Touching story (I hope) but yeah :) Hope you like it!

P.S. for those who know is kinda a crossover between Candy JEM series and the prince series by Gempak starz!
