# Chapter 1

_MC's point of view_

I open my eyes and see the blinding light shining. Where am I? I jolt out of bed and look around. The walls were white, and it had a familiar smell. Where am I? Most importantly, _who_ am I? Why am I here?

Suddenly, someone wearing a pink blouse walks in. She sees me, and rushes to me. I was taken aback, and as I stepped back in surprise, I fell back onto my bed.

Seeing that I did not recognise her, she said,"Good morning! I'm your mother and umm, the doctor says that you have amnesia. Your brother will be here in a minute, so just wait for a while, ok?"

_Hmm, she seems nice..._ I thought, as I sat on my bed and started talking to her.
