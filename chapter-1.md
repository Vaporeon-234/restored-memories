# Chapter 1

_MC's POV_

I open my eyes and see the blinding light shining. Where am I? I jolt out of bed and look around. The walls were white, and it had a familiar smell. Where am I? Most importantly, _who_ am I? Why am I here?

Suddenly, someone wearing a pink blouse walks in. She sees me, and rushes to me. I was taken aback, and as I stepped back in surprise, I fell back onto my bed.

Seeing that I did not recognise her, she said,"Good morning! I'm your mother and umm, the doctor says that you have amnesia. Your brother will be here in a minute, so just wait for a while, ok?"

_Hmm, she seems nice..._ I thought, as I sat on my bed and started talking to her.

_Brother's POV_

Ring! the school bell rang. I quickly packed my things and ran out of the classroom

"Hey! Shintarou, where are you going? Why the rush?" my classmate, Kevin asked.

I ignored him and just rushed to the hospital.

I slammed the door open and rushed to my sister's side.

"(Y/n)! You got me so worried! What happened to you?" I hugged my sister tightly and asked. I have haphephobia (fear of physical contact), but when it comes to matters involving my sister, I don't care about my fear anymore.

"What? Who are you? Why are you touching me?" she asked.

I stared at her, "I am your brother, idiot! Do you even recognise your own brother? I was so worried!"
